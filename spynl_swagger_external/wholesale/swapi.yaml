  description: '<h1>Wholesale API Overview</h1><p>
    This documentation is for the Softwear API (SWAPI) which allows third-party web
    developers to interface with web services of Softwear, BV.
    </p>
    <h1>Environments</h1>
    <p>
    Softwear offers both a test and production environment. The purpose of the test
    environment is to allow sand-boxed access to the Softwear API to setup and test your
    implementation before going live. Requests made to the test environment will not affect
    live data.
    </p>
    <p>
    It is advisable to set the URL and Access Token as environment variables in your code
    base rather than using hard-coded values to avoid any mixup between the two environments.
    For more information about access to the test environment, see below.
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <strong>TEST URL: </strong><code>https://api.test.softwearconnect.com/v1/</code>
    </li>
    <li>
    <strong>PRODUCTION URL: </strong><code>https://api.softwearconnect.com/v1/</code>
    </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h1>Access Token</h1>
    <p>
    To use this API it is required to obtain a security token at
    <a href="https://my.softwearconnect.com/#/tokens"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://my.softwearconnect.com/#/tokens</a>. The
    token must be sent with each request in the X-API-Key header of the request. <strong
    style="color: red;">Important!</strong> The access token should be stored in a
    secure location and treated like a password. DO NOT share this token with anyone
    else as this allows anyone with the token to access data. If you think your token
    has been compromised, go to&nbsp;<a href="https://my.softwearconnect.com/#/tokens"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://my.softwearconnect.com/#/tokens</a> and
    revoke the token. Then create a new token.
    </p>
    <h1>Testing Environment Access</h1>
    <p>
    There is a testing environment available which can be accessed from
    <a href="https://api.test.softwearconnect.com">https://api.test.softwearconnect.com</a>.
    This will need to be configured first before you are able to access this environment.
    Please contact <a href="https://www.softwearconnect.com/#/support" target="_blank">Softwear Support</a>
    for access to this environment. You will need a different access key for this
    environment which can be generated at <a href="https://my.test.softwearconnect.com/#/tokens">
    https://my.test.softwearconnect.com/#/tokens</a>
    </p>
    <h1>Requests</h1>
    <h2>JSON</h2>
    <p>
    SWAPI is a pure <a href="https://www.json.org/" target="_blank">JSON</a> HTTP web API which means
    that all requests and responses use content-type <code>application/json</code>.
    Thus, it is important that your environment can parse and deal with requests and
    responses in the JSON format.
    </p>
    <h2>HTTP Request Methods</h2>
    <p>
    SWAPI uses two primary <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods"
    target="_blank">HTTP Request Methods</a>: GET and POST. Mostly we use the POST method to
    both get and mutate data on the server side. The documentation below includes examples
    of requests using the GET or POST method. The method to be used will be marked on
    the left-hand side next to the resource name.
    </p>
    <h2>Request URL</h2>
    <p>
    Depending on your implementation, you will need to send a request to a particular resource.
    The documentation includes each resource path which should be appended to the base URL mentioned
    in the "Environments" section of this documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
    Example: https://api.softwearconnect.com/v1/customers/add
    </p>
    <h1>UsefulTools</h1>
    <p>
    The Softwear API can be accessed with RESTful GUIs or with command
    line tools such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL" target="blank">cURL</a>
    or <a href="https://httpie.org/" target="blank">HTTPie</a>. This documentation
    also includes a "Try It Out" button which will generate the example cURL command.</p><h1>Example
    Usage</h1><p>Below is an example of sending a request to the test environment
    using cURL. Please note that some resources require a GET request while others
    require a POST request. The GET vs POST endpoints are marked below with different
    colours.</p><p><code>curl -X GET "https://api.test.softwearconnect.com/v1/swapi/stock?barcode=11111111111"
    -H "accept: application/json" -H "X-API-Key: TEST-API-KEY"</code>
    </p>
    <h1>Support and Feedback</h1>
    <p>
    If you need support or have feedback, we want to hear it! Please contact our
    <a href="https://www.softwearconnect.com/#/support" target="_blank">support team</a> or chat with us from this
    page using the chat bubble in the lower right-hand corner.
